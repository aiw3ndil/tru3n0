I just have finished reading the Thomas Dalton translation and commmentaries on Joseph Goebbels diary.

And here are some extracts I have found interesting.

These one about coping with Jews:

>One cannot defend oneself against the Jew. He attacks with lightning speed from his position of safety and uses his abilities to crush any attempt at defense.
>
>Quickly he turns the attacker's charges back on him and the attacker becomes the liar, the troublemaker, the terrorist. Nothing could be more mistaken than to defend oneself. That's just what the Jew wants He can invent a new lie every day for the enemy to respond to, and the result is that the enemy spends so much time defending himself that he has no time to do what the Jew really fears: attack. Thc accused has become the accuser, and loudly he shoves the accuser intc the dock. So it always was in the past when a person or a movement fought the Jew. That's what would happen to us as well, were we not fully aware of his nature, and if we lacked the courage to draw thc following radical conclusions:
>
>One cannot fight the Jew by positive means. He is a negative, and this negative must be erased from the German system or he will forever corrupt it.
>
>One cannot discuss the Jewish Question with the Jews. One can hardly prove to a person that one has the duty to render him harmless.
>
>One cannot allow the Jew the same means one would give an honest opponent, for he is no honorable opponent. He will use generosity and nobility only to trap his enemy.

About the nature of the Jew and a possible solution to the Jewish Question:

>The Jewish problem will probably be the hardest to solve. These Jews are no longer human beings. [They are] predators equipped with a cold intellect, which must be rendered harmless.

>The Jews long for one thing: to reward our foolishness with bloodshed and terror. It must never come to that. One of the most effective defenses is an unforgiving, cold hardness against the destroyers of our people, against the instigators of the war, against those who would benefit if we lose, and therefore also against the victims, if we win.

More on the nature of the Jew and his tactics:

> There are no distinctions between Jews. Each Jew is a sworn enemy of the German people. If he does not make his hostility plain, it is only from cowardice and slyness, not because he loves us.

>If the Jews appeal to your sentimentality, realize that they are hoping for your forgetfulness, and let them know that you see through them and hold them in contempt.
