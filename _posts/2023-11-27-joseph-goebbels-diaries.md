I just have finished reading the Thomas Dalton translation and commmentaries on Joseph Goebbels diary.

And here are some extracts I have found interesting.

These one about coping with Jews:

>One cannot defend oneself against the Jew. He attacks with lightning speed from his position of safety and uses his abilities to crush any attempt at defense.
>
>Quickly he turns the attacker's charges back on him and the attacker becomes the liar, the troublemaker, the terrorist. Nothing could be more mistaken than to defend oneself. That's just what the Jew wants He can invent a new lie every day for the enemy to respond to, and the result is that the enemy spends so much time defending himself that he has no time to do what the Jew really fears: attack. Thc accused has become the accuser, and loudly he shoves the accuser intc the dock. So it always was in the past when a person or a movement fought the Jew. That's what would happen to us as well, were we not fully aware of his nature, and if we lacked the courage to draw thc following radical conclusions:
>
>One cannot fight the Jew by positive means. He is a negative, and this negative must be erased from the German system or he will forever corrupt it.
>
>One cannot discuss the Jewish Question with the Jews. One can hardly prove to a person that one has the duty to render him harmless.
>
>One cannot allow the Jew the same means one would give an honest opponent, for he is no honorable opponent. He will use generosity and nobility only to trap his enemy.

About the nature of the Jew and a possible solution to the Jewish Question:

>The Jewish problem will probably be the hardest to solve. These Jews are no longer human beings. [They are] predators equipped with a cold intellect, which must be rendered harmless.

>The Jews long for one thing: to reward our foolishness with bloodshed and terror. It must never come to that. One of the most effective defenses is an unforgiving, cold hardness against the destroyers of our people, against the instigators of the war, against those who would benefit if we lose, and therefore also against the victims, if we win.

>We are dealing with the most dangerous enemy that ever threatened the life, freedom, and dignity of humanity. There can be no mercy

>Primitive man did not know the lie, the Führer believes. Primitive man has only made his feelings known in a primitive manner through original sounds. There could be no question of an intention of disguising. Primitive man had no reason to think such a thing. When he felt pain, he made sounds of pain, and when he felt joy, he made sounds of joy. Of course, the more man developed intellectually, the more he also gained the ability to disguise his inner thoughts and express things other than what he felt. The Jew, as an absolutely intellectual being, was the first to learn how to master this art. He can therefore be regarded not only as the bearer, but also as the inventor of the lie among humans.

More on the nature of the Jew and his tactics:

> There are no distinctions between Jews. Each Jew is a sworn enemy of the German people. If he does not make his hostility plain, it is only from cowardice and slyness, not because he loves us.

>If the Jews appeal to your sentimentality, realize that they are hoping for your forgetfulness, and let them know that you see through them and hold them in contempt.

>A decent enemy will deserve our generosity after we have won. The Jew however is not a decent enemy, though he tries to seem so.

>One must keep at their heels, and give them no rest when they begin to tire. They are virtuosos at the art of transformation. They can appear in a thousand forms, yet are always the same. If one has caught them, they claim injured innocence and send out their guard of pity to beg for mercy. But if one extends them even a finger of pity, they chop off the whole hand. They must therefore retain the fear of God.

>It can no longer be denied, particularly since, in their drunken joy of power and victory, the Jews have forgotten their ordinarily so-carefully maintained reserve and now stand in the spotlight of public opinion. They no longer bother—apparently believing that it's no longer necessary, that their hour has come. And this is their mistake, which they always make when they think themselves near their great goal of surreptitious world domination. Throughout the history of nations, whenever this tragic situation developed, good providence saw to it that the Jews themselves became the gravediggers of their own hopes.

>They did not destroy the healthy peoples, but rather the sting of their parasitic effects brought a realization of the looming danger to the forefront, leading to the greatest sacrifices to overcome it. At a certain point, they become that power that always wants evil but inadvertently creates good.

About lawfully fight the Jews:

> It is the job of the government to deal with them. No one has the right to act on his own, but each has the duty to support the state's measures against the Jews, to defend those measures with others, and to avoid being misled by any Jewish tricks. The security of the state requires that of us all.

>Germany, in any event, has no intention of bowing before this threat, but rather intends to take the most radical measures, if necessary, In good time.

About the English people and Western culture and propaganda:

>On the basis of their very materialistic attitude, the English act similar to the Jews. They are the Aryans that have most acquired Jewish traits. Nevertheless, the English people will experience a great awakening to the Jewish Question. This awakening will be promoted and accelerated by our propaganda in every way. The sooner the day of awakening comes, the better for the salvation of Western culture and Western human society. 

>The festering wound of modern humanity has been bandaged over, but it naturally continues to fester. It will eat its way into the body, since the way outward is blocked. England and the United States will have an unpleasant experience. He who is fed by the Jews dies.

>The Führer attaches particular importance to anti-Semitic propaganda for the English and other captives. They will later become the bearers of anti-Semitic belief in their countries. I will make a whole series of anti-Semitic pamphlets for these captives and submit them to them in an innocuous way. We should not, as the Führer says, in any way discourage ourselves from treating the Jewish Question by intellectual objections. Jewish crimes must be ruthlessly denounced, otherwise people won't understand what we mean and intend.

On war:

>The Führer attaches particular importance to anti-Semitic propaganda for the English and other captives. They will later become the bearers of anti-Semitic belief in their countries. I will make a whole series of anti-Semitic pamphlets for these captives and submit them to them in an innocuous way. We should not, as the Führer says, in any way discourage ourselves from treating the Jewish Question by intellectual objections. Jewish crimes must be ruthlessly denounced, otherwise people won't understand what we mean and intend.

>This war develops step by step. The enemy makes his move, we make ours. The greatest possible effort is called for. We must go to work with our last reserves of physical and spiritual strength, and our strength of nerve and intelligence. He whose breath fails first has lost. Never forget that, in the midst of the storms and sufferings of the present age, we must always rely on our moral strength—for that is the single weapon with which we can defend ourselves.

The only time the subject of mass-murder is treated: 

>With the war now clearly turning against Germany, there were many issues more urgent than the deportation of Jews. As a consequence, we find only three relevant entries in the final six months of 1943. This fact argues strongly against those who claim that the mass-murder of the Jews was an overriding priority until the very end. Were it not for the Hungarian situation in mid-1944, we might have heard nothing more on it at all.

Here Himmler speaks about deportation of the Jews:

>October 1943 (11.10.72)

>Regarding the Jewish Question, [Himmlerl gives a very frank and candid picture. He is of the opinion that we can solve the Jewish Question for all of Europe by the end of this year. He advocates the most radical and harshest solution, namely, that the whole of Jewry will be rooted out. This is surely a consistent, if brutal, solution. We must accept the responsibility to completely solve this question in our time. Later generations will surely no longer have the courage or dedication to address this problem as we can do today.

About the conditions in the Soviet Union:

>Soviet conditions to the whole world, giving Jewry absolute power and freedom from prosecution. He who objects or even debates the matter gets a bullet in the back of his head or an axe through his neck. There is no worse tyranny than this. This is the epitome of the public and secret disgrace that Jewry inflicts on nations that deserve freedom.

### The hour will come in which all the peoples of the Earth will awaken, and the Jews will be the victims. Here, too, things can only go on for so long.
