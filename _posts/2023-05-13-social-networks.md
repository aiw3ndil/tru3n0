It's been a while since my last post. I decided to come back to Twitter and Facebook, but not Instagram.

I love to share things with my friends. But not with the world, with this I mean, my personal life and photos.

I have noticed an increase in anxiety after publishing things at the begining. Now I can publish and feel no 
anxiety at all when waiting for my friends reactions.

I decided to come back after Elon Musk bought Twitter. Because is where I share my public interests, like this
blog. And Elon is a great advocate of freedom of speech. When comes to share my thoughts, I know you're not 
gonna like this but I'm a Paganist. And it feels like you cannot say any of this on platforms like 
Facebook. Now on Twitter you can.

I don't know why Varg Vikerness was banned again but I hope him come back soon to Twitter. We need a platform
fully free for freedom of speech and Varg is a great inspiration to me when it comes to Paganism and survivalism.

So I started to choose better social networks that the currents available for example instead of YouTube I choose
odysee.

And instead of Twitch, DLive, I think they are better platforms that everyone concerned about freedom of 
speech should use.
