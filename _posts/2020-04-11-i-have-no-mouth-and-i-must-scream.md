This is my favorite fragment from the novel by Harlan Ellison, when AM speaks.

 "At first it meant Allied Mastercomputer, and then it meant Adaptative Manipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itselt up and they called it Agressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally *called itself* AM, emerging intelligence, and what it mean was I am .. *cogito ergo sum* ... I think, therefore I am".

HATE. LET ME TELL
YOU HOW MUCH I'VE
COME TO HATE YOU
SINCE I BEGAN TO
LIVE.  THERE ARE
387.44 MILLION MILES
OF PRINTED CIRCUITS
IN WAFER THIN LAYERS
THAN FILL MY
COMPLEX. IF THE
WORD HATE WAS
ENGRAVED ON EACH
NANOANGSRTOM OF
THOSE HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF MILES IT
WOULD NOT EQUAL
ONE ONE-BILLIONTH
OF THE HATE I FEEL
FOR HUMANS AT THIS
MICRO-INSTANT FOR
YOU. HATE. HATE.
AM said it with the sliding cold horror of a razor
blade slicing my eyeball. AM said it with the 
bubbling thickness of my lungs filling with phlegm,
drowning me from within.
