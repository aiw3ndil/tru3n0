    <p>Recently I started to feel a lot of anxiety.</p>

<p>I used to have to have a lot of things in mind, read a lot every day, keep myself updated on
almost every skill I have.</p>

<p>This implies my hobbies as well. You know, videogames, anime, listen to every new metal band,
and of course add new hobbies to the list.</p>

<p>For more than 10 years I was feeling the necessity of constant input stream. Some times I was
nervous about “losing my way”.</p>

<p>So I started to just leave things, the first thing I needed to get rid off was social pressure.
As stupid as it sounds, having nothing to say during social interactions may feel very 
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>At the begining I feel a lot of pressure to interact with other people, sitting in silence
was very difficult to me after years sharing my interests with people and getting input
from them.</p>

<p>But the more I shared and get to know about others opinions, likes and passions the less sense
of individuality I feel. My microcosmos was dissapearing and with the passing of years,
every feeling that conformed my personality was absolutely a distant echo.</p>

<p>What about my first years as an individual, the curiosity, the need to know more about things.</p>

<p>And of course the concentration that only brings passion.</p>

<p>Now, my only input from the outside world is that than I can get from books.</p>

<p>I started to unsubscribe myself from every single network I was and attending only to vital
matters from my contacts and friends.</p>
