        </h3><p>During this two years I have been being more and more antisocial. I just attended to family reunions
and abandoned all my morning visits to my nearest coffee shop. I used to go every day, drink orange
juice with two sandwhiches and look around me for a while. I found comfort in silence. I used to do
a lot of walking every day, but somehow I feel very distracted from my purpose, that of endure on
my skills.</p>

of James Baudrillard about the consumer society and just re-realized the quote from The Matrix 
movie: “Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living.” We are
just living the same production/consuming cycles over and over again.</p>

        </h3><p>Well. This has been a tough year. Very difficult in so many ways. At least I’m sure I have found real love. A real, 
close and deep connection with a woman. For the first time in my life I feel the immensity of that word, and the power 
that holds inside. At the beginning it feels like your entire world and even image of yourself is melting down. 
So who you really are? This time that doesn’t matter. What really matters is that you are going to born again in a 
new being. This “new” being seems like a mental image of yourself (at least for me) close to an illusion, but with 
a strain that makes you feel that this is an eternal gift and you are going to a place where the physical doesn’t 
matter that much. In one word: Eternity.</p>

When I was eleven years old I give Basic a first try. I get amazed very fast with loops,
the goto function and the possibility of emit sounds at a determined frequency
with the computer speaker, also get to know the use of hex colors. Creating interactive
scripts was funny because I could create start scripts for my games and favorite applications.</p>
